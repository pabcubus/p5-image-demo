# P5 IMAGE DEMO
This is just a little demo using P5 library for a demo using images (Link from Zelda).

To run the project, go to the Terminal or CMD and type:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/pabcubus/p5-image-demo
$ cd /folder/where/you/cloned/the/project
$ npm install
$ serve
```

Then, go to your browser and enter to `localhost:3000`. To move the character just use the arrow keys, and to fire a ball use space.

Have Fun!
